# Logic-Gates

#### AND
two inputs, outputs one if both inputs are one.


#### FULL ADDER
three inputs, outputs **sum** of bits, and **carry** bit


#### HALF ADDER
two inputs, outputs **sum** of bits, and **carry** bit


#### MUX
A simple multiplexor (Mux) is a three-input gate that uses one of the inputs, called ‘selection
bit’, to select and output one of the other two inputs, called ‘data bits’.

#### NOR   
Two inputs, outputs one if neither input is one.   
   
#### NOT
One input, outputs the opposite of that input

#### XOR 
Two inputs, outputs one if one and only one input is one (exclusive or)
