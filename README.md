# Logic-Gates
   

#### ADD 16
Adds two 16-bit inputs, The most significant carry bit is ignored.   
   
#### AND
two inputs, outputs one if both inputs are one.
   
#### FULL ADDER
three inputs, outputs **sum** of bits, and **carry** bit
   
#### HALF ADDER
two inputs, outputs **sum** of bits, and **carry** bit
   
#### INC16
one 16 bit input, outputs input + 1
   
#### MUX
A simple multiplexor (Mux) is a three-input gate that uses one of the inputs, called ‘selection
bit’, to select and output one of the other two inputs, called ‘data bits’.
   
#### NOR   
Two inputs, outputs one if neither input is one.   
     
#### NOT
One input, outputs the opposite of that input
   
#### XOR 
Two inputs, outputs one if one and only one input is one (exclusive or)
